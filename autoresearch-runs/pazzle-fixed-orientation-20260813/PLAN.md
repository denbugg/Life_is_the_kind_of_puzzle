R0 baseline: reproduce source-disjoint directional retrieval and R@K.
R1 [data/objective]: multi-band boundary embedding plus same-image hard negatives; expected R@20 >= +0.10; falsified by no R@20/worst-recall gain.
R2 [architecture]: fixed-direction multi-scale RGB/gradient/frequency fusion; expected positive R@5/R@20 delta; falsified by no reliable gain.
R3 [calibration]: top-K retrieval plus cross-encoder reranker; expected precision gain at fixed recall; falsified by recall loss or flat precision.
G1 [global]: induced-attention tile-to-coarse-region prior, no rotations; expected union-recall gain; falsified by no slot-rank improvement.
No production edit without a named hypothesis and baseline measurement.
F2 [calibration/fusion]: frozen PairwiseNet row-z plus F1 direct-pose heuristic ranking; mechanism: independent seam evidence removes false positives from R3 union; expected top1 precision >=0.35; falsified by no gain over F1.
F2b [operating point]: fixed top-k sweep 1/2/4/8/16 on same frozen fusion scores; mechanism: select a sparse candidate graph with the best held-out precision/coverage trade-off before assignment; falsified by no K with precision >=0.25 and all-direct recall >=0.15.
P1 [hard-negative objective]: fine-tune PairwiseNet with normalized real/synthetic hard-negative cache; mechanism: photometric normalization plus hard seams improves pair score calibration in R3 union; expected top1 fusion precision>=0.45 at no lower recall; falsified by no F2 gain.
