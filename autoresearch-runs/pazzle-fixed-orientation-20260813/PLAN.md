R0 baseline: reproduce source-disjoint directional retrieval and R@K.
R1 [data/objective]: multi-band boundary embedding plus same-image hard negatives; expected R@20 >= +0.10; falsified by no R@20/worst-recall gain.
R2 [architecture]: fixed-direction multi-scale RGB/gradient/frequency fusion; expected positive R@5/R@20 delta; falsified by no reliable gain.
R3 [calibration]: top-K retrieval plus cross-encoder reranker; expected precision gain at fixed recall; falsified by recall loss or flat precision.
G1 [global]: induced-attention tile-to-coarse-region prior, no rotations; expected union-recall gain; falsified by no slot-rank improvement.
